This Python program needs the following libraries to run:

- nltk (plus several corpora, run nltk.download()
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- pandas
- numpy

-> Adjust classifiers and saving of corpora and/or trained classifiers to your needs in Sentiment-Analyzer.py
-> View measures for text normalization in normalization.py
-> View feature matrix generator in utils.py

Source data for SentimentAnalyzer:
Training and test data set have to be .csv-files (2 columns: "review" (text) and "sentiment" (positive/negative). You
can generate such a file with the script in data_extraction.py

The most important function is probably the normalize_corpus(...)-function in normalization.py, as it does a lot of
work in cleaning up the texts from the source. There are lots of possibilities for modifications - just as there are
lots of parameters to be tinkered with for each individual classifier.
